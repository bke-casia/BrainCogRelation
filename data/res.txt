start: basal ganglia -> prefrontal cortex ### to further address the role of attention and executive function in pwm and ds , we also review neurobiological models proposing that prefrontal cortex ( pfc ) and basal ganglia ( bg ) function to facilitate working memory under distracting conditions and neuroimaging evidence implicating the pfc and bg in stuttering .
